# Hello 👋

I'm [Lee Nattress](https://github.com/leenattress) and I code.

# Contents

  - ⛃ Draughts discussion with way too many emoji

---

# Draughts

---

# Architecture

- Frontend is a StencilJs application
- Ionic framework
- Mobile first
- Progressive Web Application
- No server/backend required

--- 

# 🤔

- Hosted in a bucket (cheap!)
- Behind a Cloudfront Distribution (fast!)
- Bucket is not public (safe!)
- Trivial to update (CI/CD!)
- No traffic limit (scales!)

--- 

# 💎 Clarity - Readme

- What makes a good `readme.md`
- How to get started
- How to play

---

# Technical tradeoffs

  - Reusability for time
  - Client only (It was nearly multi-player 🏸)
  - Ditched SVG for DOM (🏃‍♀️ it was fast enough...)
  - Simpler visual design than I wanted
  - CSS trickery

---

# 🎯 Correctness

---

## What's In?

- Draughts re-usable library
- Jest unit tested, green and red paths
- Taking turns, moving properly, capturing, kings. 
- Serverless (sls) deployment yml with bucket and cloudfront ⛅
- Fully playable locally on desktop, mobile, tablet
- 🔊 Snazzy(tm) sound effects

--- 

## What's Out?

- Win condition (out of time! ⏰)
- 'You must capture if you can'
- The magical multiplayer I wanted 🧙‍♂️
- e2e Testing! Oh no! 😥

---

# 🧐 Code quality

- Prettify on save
- TypeScript
- Good unit tests

---

> 🤔 Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Is there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follow principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?

---

<CodeSurfer theme={vsDark}>

```js
// Single-responsibility principle
/**
  * getId
  * Creates a short ID from a character set, of a required length
  *  */
getId(length: number) {
    var result = '';
    var characters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
    var charactersLength = characters.length;
    for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        result += characters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * charactersLength));
    }
    return result;
}
```


```js 2:2
  // Green apples, random strings? 
  it('🍏 [RUGBUR] should setup the board', () => {
      draughts.setupGame('test');
      const game: Game = draughts.getGame('test');
      expect(game.spaces.length).toBe(8); // 8 rows
      expect(game.spaces[0].length).toBe(8); // 8 columns
  });
```

```js 2:2 
  it('🍏 [RUGBUR] should setup the board', () => {
      draughts.setupGame('test');
      const game: Game = draughts.getGame('test');
      expect(game.spaces.length).toBe(8); // 8 rows
      expect(game.spaces[0].length).toBe(8); // 8 columns
  });
```

```js 3:5 
  it('🍏 [RUGBUR] should setup the board', () => {
      draughts.setupGame('test');
      const game: Game = draughts.getGame('test');
      expect(game.spaces.length).toBe(8); // 8 rows
      expect(game.spaces[0].length).toBe(8); // 8 columns
  });
```

```js 3:3 
  it('🍎 [OXIEVX] shold throw an error when the game does not exist', () => {
      expect(() => {
          draughts.setPlayer('zzxxzxzx', 12, 15, 1)
      }).toThrow("The game does not exist")
  });
```

```js 4:4 
  it('🍎 [OXIEVX] shold throw an error when the game does not exist', () => {
      expect(() => {
          draughts.setPlayer('zzxxzxzx', 12, 15, 1)
      }).toThrow("The game does not exist")
  });
```

# 🔒 Security

- No server to interact with
- 🙄 Bucket is private - CloudFront does all the work.

--- 

# ✅ Testing

- Jest spec tests covering `draughts.ts`
  - 30+ tests
  - Red and green path
  - Correct error trapping/bubbling
  - Bonus: Errors thrown used in frontend
- `draughts.ts` designed to be used in multiplayer server
- No integration tests 😭 (time!) 

---

> { 🦜 Talk about testing here }

---

# 📊 UX

- Beautiful Ionic Re-usables
- Custom board web-component
- StencilJs reactivity
- Mobile first (📱 Tappy tap)

# 🔧 Technical Choices

---

> 📦 Stencil was chosen becasuse I have a strong professional working knowledge of it. It makes SPA, as the requirement specified.

---

> 📱 Ionic gave me a headstart on this UI. I did not want to be bogged down by fiddly buttons while making the board and rules.

---

> 🌳 AWS s3 and cloudfront for deployment because serverless and daily experience.

---

# 🗻 Scalability

- 🤑 The only limit to the amount of users who can play Draughts, is our wallet.
- AWS makes sure our SPA will not slow down or go offline

---

# Production-readiness

Does the code include monitoring? logging? - **CloudWatch**

Proper error handling? - Draughts library has wonderful throws.

---

# Next Steps

- Nest server with socket io for multiplayer
- Add in the missing parts!
- Prettier graphics
- Cognito login and persistent win/loss record with DynamoDb
- Maybe mobile app on app store with ads

---


# I Learned About

- Different variations of draughts (Malaysian checkers! 12x12 board!)
- 500,995,484,682,338,672,639 possible positions
- The unbeatable computer is called 'Chinook'
- First draughts program: February 1951
- Games have 'Notation'.
- 😤 *huffing*
