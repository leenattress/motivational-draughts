```

## Stack Deploy

To run serverless commands that interface with your AWS account, you will need to setup your AWS account credentials on your machine.

### Serverless Install
```bash
npm install -g serverless
```

### Deploy
```bash
sls deploy --infraStackName STACK_NAME --aws-profile AWS_PROFILE
```

Where `STACK_NAME` is a string, like `lee` or `production` and where `AWS_PROFILE` is a profile found in your `~/.aws/credentials` file.

Once deployed, get your CloudFront url by running

```bash
sls info --infraStackName STACK_NAME --aws-profile AWS_PROFILE --verbose
```
